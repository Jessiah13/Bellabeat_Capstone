-- Data exploration, cleaning and exporting were completed in SQL (SQL SEVER). 
-- Data visualization was completed with Tableau.
-- The Following tables were used; dailyActivity_merged, sleepDay_merged & WeightLogInfo_merged.

-- Viewing Data 
SELECT *

-- Observation: info in the date field isn't formated as date values.

-- Date is formated to include time, however the time recorded isn't relevant.
